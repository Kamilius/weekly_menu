Weekly menu planning
----------------------

To build a project you'll need to:
* install nodejs and npm
* install PostgreSQL database
* clone repository
* run '$ node install' in repository
* run '$ grunt build' in repository
* run '$ node server.js' in root of repository to start back-end server
* go to http://localhost:3001

After those operations, 'build/' directory will be generated with all needed assets.

This project uses next HTML/HTML5 API's:
* Drag and Drop,
* DOM,
* Form validation

Technologies used: 
* AngularJS v1.3.0
* Bootstrap v3.3.0
* NPM/Grunt JS Task runner (for project build and dependencies)
* HAML/SASS/CoffeeScript
* NodeJS with ExpressJS (as backend)
* PostgreSQL (as database)
