Weekly menu planning
----------------------

To build a project you'll need to:
* install nodejs and npm
* clone repository
* run '$ node install' in repository
* run '$ grunt build' in repository

After those operations, 'build/' directory will be generated with all needed assets.

This project uses next HTML/HTML5 API's:
* LocalStorage,
* Drag and Drop,
* DOM,
* Form validation

Technologies used: 
* AngularJS v1.3.0
* Bootstrap v3.3.0
* NPM/Grunt JS Task runner (for project build and dependencies)
* HAML/SASS/CoffeeScript

All AngularJS view templates are local, so you don't need any web-server to run this project.<br/>
All data stored in LocalStorage of your browser.
